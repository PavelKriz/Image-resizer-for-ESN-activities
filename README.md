# Image-resizer-for-ESN-activities

This app resizes image to 1920x460, maintains aspect ratio and adds white background (meets specification of activities.esn.org)

## Why 

To add activity to activities.esn.org a image of an exact size 1920x460 is needed. So this python application was created to change every image to this format.

## Supported image formats

".bmp",".dib",".jpeg",".jpg",".png",".webp",".pbm",".pgm",".ppm",".pxm",".pnm",".tiff",".tif",".hdr",
